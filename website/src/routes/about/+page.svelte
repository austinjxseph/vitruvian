                      I’d always wanted to be a builder. With my teenage years
                      spent obsessing over new interfaces and tinkering with
                      code, it wasn&#x27;t long before I kicked off an
                      engineering degree. Somewhere down the line - I realised I
                      loved building ideas a bit more when they were mine - and
                      pivoted to design. Eventually, my journey came full
                      circle, having connected the dots between my love for
                      code, and passion for design.

                      After a Master’s Degree, I&#x27;ve fully segued into the
                      design industry as a creative developer, bridging the
                      worlds of binaries and hexes. And now, I’ve found my
                      Ikigai - building aesthetic and functional experiences as
                      a unicorn, one pixel at a time - while working with font
                      nerds.
